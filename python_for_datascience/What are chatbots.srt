Welcome to Build Your Own Chatbot! My name is Antonio Cangiano and I’m a Software

1
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:11,190
Developer and Technical Evangelist at IBM. In this course, you’ll learn how to build

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,289
chatbots that rely on Natural Language Processing, without having to write any code.

3
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:22,330
You may have heard a lot of chatter, pun fully intended, around them. And that’s for a

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,660
good reason. Chatbots are increasingly transforming the

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,100
way we interact with software. They provide a great business opportunity for both small

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,640
and large companies. But first, what are chatbots?

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,239
Chatbots can be defined as software agents that converse through a chat interface. Now,

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,469
what that means is that they’re software programs that are able to have a conversation,

9
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:47,870
which provides some kind of value to the end user.

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,820
The user can interact with the chatbot by typing in their end of the conversation, or

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,730
simply by using their voice, depending on the type of chatbot provided.

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,929
Virtual assistants like Apple Siri or Amazon Alexa are two examples of popular chatbots

13
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:09,890
interacting via voice rather than text. Typically, the chatbot will greet the user

14
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,840
and then invite them to ask some kind of question. When the user replies, the chatbot will parse

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,950
the input and figure out what’s the intention of the user’s question. Finally, it will

16
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,050
respond in some form of consequential or logical manner, either providing information or asking

17
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,530
for further details before ultimately answering the question.

18
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,980
Great chatbots can keep up this back and forth in a natural way, within the scope of what

19
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,960
the chatbot is designed to do. They make the user feel understood and helped. They create

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,350
a certain rapport with the user, without pretending to be human.

21
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,780
Very often chatbots offer some form of virtual assistance to the user. They provide maybe

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,910
customer or sales support, often collecting information from the user to provide some

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,340
form of service. For example, Kayak offers a chatbot that will

24
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,120
ask the user trip-relevant questions in order to simplify the process of booking their travel

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,120
arrangements. Spotify’s chatbot makes it very easy to

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,930
find songs and share them with your friends on social media.

27
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,819
Harper Collins’ Epic Reads is a chatbot, a very fun one actually, that recommends

28
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:27,430
books from their catalog depending on your favorite authors, books, or maybe just the

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,200
current mood you’re in. And the Starbucks’ chatbot even allows you

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,120
to order your favorite latte directly through a chat.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,870
Aside from assistant-type chatbots, there are other type of chatbots, too, such as social

32
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,209
bots that interact with users on Twitter, entertainment bots whose main goal is to provide

33
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,310
amusement to the user, those developed for research purposes, and unfortunately even

34
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,579
spam chatbots such as fake users interacting with real ones on dating sites.

35
00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:00,430
The first historic chatbots in the late sixties and early seventies, were in fact mostly an

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,689
exercise in coming up with seemingly intelligent and human-like chatbots with relatively simple

37
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,170
technology. In this course, we’ll develop the type of

38
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,459
chatbot that provides information to customers, as they tend to be quite useful for most businesses.

39
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:23,310
Our chatbot will also use text, rather than audio, to converse with our users.

40
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,680
Since no code is involved, you don’t need to be a programmer to follow along as we go

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,560
about creating our chatbot together. Of course, if you are a programmer, you’ll be able

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,299
to take the chatbot further on your own by improving it and integrating it with other

43
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,290
services and APIs. Before we proceed further, it’s worth noting

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,909
that sometimes you might hear the word “bot” rather than chatbot in this course or elsewhere

45
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:57,790
online. Depending on the context, it’s acceptable to use bot in lieu of chatbot to mean the

46
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,040
same thing. Nevertheless, the term bot is more generic

47
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,299
and there are software programs that independently perform a certain operation on our behalf

48
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,810
without being chatbots. For example, a trader bot might monitor the market for certain conditions

49
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,300
and then perform automated stock trading transactions based on that information. That’s not a

50
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,700
chatbot, since no chatting is taking place. So, the conversational element is what makes

51
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,030
a bot a chatbot. There are many other terms that refer to chatbots,

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:37,010
such as chatterbot, chatterbox, talkbot, virtual assistant, virtual agent, Conversational Agent, embodied

53
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:43,240
agent, and even Artificial Conversational Entity or its acronym, ACE. And believe it

54
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,500
or not that’s not even an exhaustive list. Since this is a fast-growing field, new terminologies

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,950
are always introduced. But I like to keep things simple, so I will generally stick to

56
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,840
chatbot and occasionally bot in this course.
